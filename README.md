This course was part of the third term. We used **R** and **Python**, including the following libraries:  

- **R**: `ggplot2`, `ggstatsplot`, `ggrepel`, `maps`, `patchwork`, `gganimate`, `ggiraph`, `visNetwork`, `plotly`, `shiny`  
- **Python**: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  

We primarily worked with **RStudio** and **Jupyter Notebook**.
